# Ideas for the report:
short introduction (what is the project about)
Write about different penmark annotation. Most of the time it was either 0 or 1 but there were some cases where we did not agree if it is a penmark or a vein.
Write about how we made the annotations for hair. For example, if the hair was blonde it was more common that we did not see it and vice versa with black hair.
Compare grading of penmarks and hair.
